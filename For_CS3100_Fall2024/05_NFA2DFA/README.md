Basics of NFA2DFA

Every_3Block_Has2.ipynb is an interesting construction where
we easily obtain an NFA for the complement of the desired language
(say "L") and then obtain a DFA, and then complement it!

This is often easier than a direct design of a DFA for the
desired language, L.

In our case, the desired language L is "Every 3Block must have
two 1's in it." Read and run the Every_3Block_Has2.ipynb file
for more insights and details!
